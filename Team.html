In particular, with over 10 years of experience, our teacher Dan is the most experienced admissions consultant in Paris. It is thanks to this knowledgable team that Vincia Prep was chosen by Ecole Polytechnique to present the GMAT and GRE during their workhop in 2018, and by GMACâ„¢, the creator of the GMAT, to present the GMAT to all of France in 2019 during their webinar. Finally, not only will you receive quality tutoring, but our unique materials combine years of research with the best ideas from almost every other major company.  This will give you insights, strategies, and tricks that won't be found in any other individual book.  All of these things together mean that we'll help you reach your maximum test score.
