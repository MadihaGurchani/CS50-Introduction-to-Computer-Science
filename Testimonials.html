    <p>When I decided to apply for an MBA, I was a bit frightened by the GMAT. I first self-studied but could not get a better score that 480. Then I looked for a tutor, and found Dan thanks to this website. After we met for a couple of hours, I knew it would be of a great value for me. Dan's team provided me the necessary theoretical material covered by the GMAT and also the corresponding practical work. During each class we corrected my homework and my teacher helped me understand why I made the mistakes I made. Even in-between classes Dan was available by e-mail to help me when I did not understand a concept. Vincia's teachers are very supportive and patient, which I highly appreciated as the quantitative part gave me a hard time! Once all the concepts had been covered, Vincia offers some CATs, which allow you to easily see the how you can make improvement and your weakest points. </p>
